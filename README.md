# Eris
The ultimate [Elkia](https://elkia.life) automation, fun and housekeeping maid.

*Eris is just an interface for manipulating and displaying some of the elkia data from Atlas. She won't work just by her own.*

---

>ES6, MongoDB, no models, no schemas, no tests - fuck that shit, ain't nobody got time for that.

## Running

Requires Node 8 and a MongoDB server.

- Navigate into the folder, run `npm install` to get libraries.
- While that's going on, edit the *config.example.json* (To yet be provided)
- Remove all the comments in *config.example.json* telling you what goes where - as json doesn't support comments. If you're using any semi-decent IDE it should've been screaming at you ever since you opened it.
- Finally rename  *config.example.json* to simply *config.json*
- Run with `node index.js` (Run script to yet be provided)

## Contributing

As this is a personal project quite heavily targeted at very specific audience, I don't really feel like fucking with other people's code.
Unless I told you to add some shit, consider your commit rejected.

## License

I'm not a fan on licenses, so there's none. All of this is released into the public domain. Use this code as you please, fork it, print it, sell it, burn it - I don't care.
No need to credit me or anything, would be nice tho.
